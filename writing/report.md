### Article 1
 -  Article name.
 - Despite past denials, LAPD has used facial recognition software 30,000 times in last decade, records show

-  Reference or article citation.
 - https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-09-21/lapd-controversial-facial-recognition-software

- Briefly describe the article's premise.
 - The LAPD has been using facial recognition to assist them to solve crimes. The article states that the LAPD says they have nothing to hide, and uses facial recognition, but also denies using facial recognition. It was a bit confusing, but it seems that they use facial recognition only to assist their cases, rather than basing them off of it.

- What is the ethical concern, in your opinion?
 - Other than a breach of privacy, the main concern is the accuracy of the software. Minorities are at a higher risk of false recognition that ranges from 10 - 100 times more than white faces. On the other hand, this software does help the police to solve more crimes. The ethical dilemma is how the police uses this software. I don't believe that the software is inherently unethical. What can make it unethical is the way it is used. If the police is biased against minorities prior the use, then it could pose a big problem.

- What data is being manipulated in the article?
 - In this article, the data that is used is faces from over 9 million mugshots, crime scenes, witnesses, surveillance systems, and "other sources".

- Briefly describe the analysis, as you understand it.
 - I'm assuming facial recognition is using some sort of AI to compare photos and match them with the closest similarity in features and complexions of the face.

- Who stands to lose or to gain something from this form of analysis?
 - The police has much to gain as it assists them to solve more cases. Minorities, if the software is misused, can be at a great risk of false accusations.


### Article 2
 -  Article name.
 - TikTok: What is the app and how much data does it collect?

-  Reference or article citation.
 - https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-53476117

- Briefly describe the article's premise.
 - TikTok is a massively popular social media platform that has hundreds of millions of downloads worldwide. The "strange" addiction of this platform is the collection of data for each individual person to enhance their experience. This article goes on to explain what data is collected and the potential political usage of this platform.

- What is the ethical concern, in your opinion?
 - The ethical concern with this app is the sheer amount of data collected from the user. While the data is used to optimize the user's experience and time spent on the app, the data could be used for mal-intended purposes.

- What data is being manipulated in the article?
 - The data that is being collected from the application are the following: time spent on videos, comments on videos, location, phone make, and keystroke rhythm. A controversial data that is also collected is the access of copy-and-paste clipboard. However other large data hungry platforms also use this practice.

- Briefly describe the analysis, as you understand it.
 - To optimize the best "for you page" for each person, TikTok determines a person's interest by seeing how long they watch certain videos, and finding videos that are related to those videos with the immense amount of data they collect. Not only does the amount of time the video is watch matters, but the behavior of a person's keystroke on the platform is also being harvested. For instance, if someone were to swipe right and left to see more of a certain video or user, TikTok would use that information to suggest similar videos or more from that user.

- Who stands to lose or to gain something from this form of analysis?
 - The company gains much from this for optimizing their app time usage, downloads, and marketing. The potential losers could be if the data is manipulated in any way. For instance, during this upcoming election, censorship of a certain candidate or an extra advertisement for the other could potentially affect the political perspective of the users.
